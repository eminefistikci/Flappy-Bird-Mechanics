# Flappy Bird Clone

A classic 2D endless runner game developed with Unity and C#. 

**This project marks a special milestone for me: it is the first game I have built entirely on my own.**

## About the Project
I developed this project to understand the fundamentals of game development using the Unity Engine. It has been an incredibly fun and educational journey. Through this project, I learned how to manage game states, handle 2D physics, and implement UI elements from scratch.
While this is a clone of a classic game, it served as a perfect playground for me to get comfortable with C# scripting and the Unity editor.

## Features
* **Infinite Gameplay:** Pipes spawn at random heights endlessly.
* **Score System:** Tracks current score.
* **Sound Effects:** Integrated audio for jumping, scoring, and collisions.
* **Game Over Logic:** Collision detection and replay mechanics.

## Tech Stack
* **Engine:** Unity 2022 (LTS)
* **Language:** C#
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

##  How to Play
1.  Clone the repository or download the build.
2.  Press **Left Click** (or tap) to make the bird jump.
3.  Avoid the pipes and the ground!

##  What's Next?
This project taught me that I really enjoy game development. Now that I have grasped the basics, **my goal is to start working on my own original game ideas.** I plan to expand my knowledge in Unity and create more complex mechanics in the future.
